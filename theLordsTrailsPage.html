            <p>The theme for the game was haunted Castle, in which we had to incorporate two prompts. This game follows Dracula who was captured and weaken by The King in Yellow. Dracula must escape through the castle, but each room contains a puzzle. If he is able to solve them correctly, he will regain blood and unlock the door to venture forward. However, each room and overall game has a timer to complete. Depending on the amount of blood the player earns and the timer, will result on a specific ending.</p>
